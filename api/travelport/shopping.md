    * P = 護照\(旅行證件類型\)
    * GB = 發行國
    * 123456788 = 證件號碼
    * GB = 乘客國籍
    * 12JUN63 = 出生日期
    * M = 男性
    * 23OCT14 = 證件過期時間 \(旅行證件類型\)
    * SMITH = 姓
    * JOHN = 名

* #### DOCA SSR

  對於DOCA SSR，如果指定地址類型（R-Residential或D-Destination地址），則應指定地址的國家/地區，反之亦然。

  * 例如，SSR Type =“DOCA”FreeText =“HK1 / R / US / 1600 SMITH ST / HOUSTON / TX / 77001”Carrier =“BA”                                             /R/指定住址的地址碼，/US/指定國家的地址碼，國家地址碼之後的地址格式是用“/”來分隔每個地址元素。

* #### DOCO SSR

  對於DOCO SSR，如果簽證信息的要求因提供者而異。對於所有的提供者，附加的旅行信息證件類型（例如，簽證）和附加的旅行信息號碼（例如，簽證號碼）必須一起登記或者全部不登記。

  證件類型“R”：旅客護照識別號碼和“K”：已知的旅行者編號可以在DOCO SSR中輸入他們各自的編號。一個護照識別碼或已知的旅行者編號類型總是需要一個補充的履行信息號碼。                                                                                                                                                                                  在一個DOCO SSR中，一個護照識別碼必須為旅行者提供一個DOCS SSR。                        &lt;br&gt;                                                                                                     在所有情況下，驗證都是由提供者執行的。                                                                                                                                                                                                               下表列出了可以在Universal API作為SSR DOCO的FreeText發送的visa（簽證）信息，以及在Galileo和ACH中需要哪些字段。
